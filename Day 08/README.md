# Day 08 - Caesar Cypher

## What I created
I created a simple Caesar cypher.

## What I learned/used
- How to create and use my own functions
- Usage of ord/chr to convert alpha/numeric characters for manipulation

## Challenges I faced
As the original project uses lists to loop through the characters. I had some trouble with the ord numbers looping back from z to a (for example), I've created a solution with some formulas but I may need to revisit to make it more intuitive.

## Code
